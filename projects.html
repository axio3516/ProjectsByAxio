    <h2>Drawbridge</h2>
    <p>Drawbridge is my first project, and it is a tool that you can use to incorporate visual progress throughout daily tasks! It motivates you by allowing you to draw one stroke every ten minutes as you focus, slowly building up a masterpiece! Drawbridge makes it easy for both beginners and experienced artists to stay productive! Good luck with your endeavors, and I hope this project can help!
